- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @randomqwery
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of different things but here I would like to focus on programming and general principles of computer science/IT.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning basics of programming and I'm trying to get my hands on IT topics.
- I'm open to any advices that can help me on my programming road :)
